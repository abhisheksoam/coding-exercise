## Notes

    - BFS (Breadth-first-search)
       It is an important graph search algorithm which helps
       in solving Analysing problems, mapping routes and scheduling
       which are majorly graph problems. 
       
       For a graph G=(V,E) and a source vertex v, breadth-first search traverses the edges of G to find all reachable vertices from v.
       It also computes the shortest distance to any reachable vertex. 
       Any path between two points in a breadth-first search tree corresponds to the shortest path from the root v 
       to any other node s.
