**Dynamic Programming**

The idea behind this Algorithmic technique is that to save the answer for sub-problems and avoid the computation state. 

It avoid repeated work, solving same sub-problems. 
It is just: Recursion + Space

Famous Algorithms:
 -  Unix Diff
 - Bellman Ford
 - Tex
 - WASP
 
 
Majority of Dynamic programming problems can be classified into two category:

-  Optimization: It expect you to select the feasible solution, so that value of a function is maximized or minimized.
-  Combinatorial: It except to find number of ways of an event or probability.

General Approach:

1) Break down problem into optimal sub-problems 
2) 
3)
4)
